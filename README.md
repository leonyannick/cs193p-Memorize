Memorize - Emoji Memory Game

Memorize is a small iOS game I created for the course cs193p. The goal is to match pairs of emoji cards by flipping them over and remembering their positions.

Features

-Themed Emoji Cards - Play with different themes and colors.
-Score Tracking - Gain points by matching pairs. Flipping cards that have previously been seen without matching is penalized
-Shuffle & Restart - Start a new game anytime with a randomized board.
-Animations - Flipping cards and shuffling is animated.
